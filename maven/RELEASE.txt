Instructions to release jMock artifacts for Maven 2.

The parent pom supports two profiles:  jmock1 and jmock2
The profile determines which artifacts are part of the release.

The pom have two types of versions: 
- the parent pom version, whose snapshot is 'x-SNAPSHOT'.  This is valid for both jmock1 and jmock2
- the child pom version, which depends on the jMock release version, eg '2.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
- the jMock release version which pulls down the released jars, eg '2.0.0'

The easiest way to release is to use the maven release plugin which will interactively ask to replace the 
snapshots with the appropriate version, eg:  
- x-SNAPSOT -> 2.0.0
- 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT -> 2.0.0
and create an scm tag with the snapshots resolved.

Unfortunately, the scm tagging required by the release plugin seems to fail with cvs.  
Until scm migrated to svn, a manual find & replace is required for the snapshot versions.

Then, to deploy 

mvn -Pprofile deploy  where profile=jmock1 or jmock2
